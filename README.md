# Chromakey
Currently, video games, movies, commercials, and television shows are ubiquitous in modern society. 
However, beneath the surface of their visual variety lies sophisticated technology, which can produce impressive effects. 
One such technology is chromakey --- a method that allows to change the background to any other image or video. 
Recognizing chromakey technology in video plays a key role in finding fake materials. 
In this paper, we consider approaches based on deep learning models that allows to recognize chromakey in video based on unnatural artifacts that arise during the transition between frames. 
The video consists of a sequence of frames, and the the video accuracy can be determined in different ways. 
If we consider the accuracy frame by frame, our method reaches an $F_1$ score equal to $0.67$. 
If we consider the entire video to be fake in case there is one or more fake segments, then the $F_1$ score equal to $0.76$. 
The proposed methods showed better results on the dataset we collected in comparison with existing methods for chromakey detection.
